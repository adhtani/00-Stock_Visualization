# Stock_Visualization  
  
**Introduction**  

The purpose of this project is to do analysis of company stocks data while also work to create relational database. Data was collected from 3 different data sources. .csv, a table from the webpage and API source. All 3 data must be relational. Datasets were messy and required lots of data wrangling. After cleaning, all 3 datasets were loaded in the SQL, merged in the SQL and then downloaded back. This project gives the opportunity to learn to handle messy data, data cleaning techniques, data transforming techniques and SQL skills.
